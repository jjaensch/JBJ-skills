# Data structures
GeoPandas implements two main data structures, a GeoSeries and a GeoDataFrame. These are subclasses of `pandas.Series` and `pandas.DataFrame`, respectively.

## GeoSeries
A GeoSeries is essentially a vector where each entry in the vector is a set of shapes corresponding to one observation. An entry may consist of only one shape (like a single polygon) or multiple shapes that are meant to be thought of as one observation (like the many polygons that make up the State of Hawaii or a country like Indonesia).

GeoPandas has three basic classes of geometric objects (which are actually Shapely objects):

- Points / Multi-Points
- Lines / Multi-Lines
- Polygons / Multi-Polygons

> **Note:** All entries in a GeoSeries do not need to be of the same geometric type, although certain export operations will fail if this is not the case.

### Overview of attributes and methods
The GeoSeries class implements nearly all of the attributes and methods of Shapely objects. When applied to a GeoSeries, they will apply elementwise to all geometries in the series. Binary operations can be applied between two GeoSeries, in which case the operation is carried out elementwise. The two series will be aligned by matching indices. Binary operations can also be applied to a single geometry, in which case the operation is carried out for each element of the series with that geometry. In either case, a Series or a GeoSeries will be returned, as appropriate.

A short summary of a few attributes and methods for GeoSeries is presented here, and a full list can be found in the GeoSeries API reference. There is also a family of methods for creating new shapes by expanding existing shapes or applying set-theoretic operations like "union" described in Geometric manipulations.

#### Attributes
- `area`: shape area (units of projection – see projections)
- `bounds`: tuple of max and min coordinates on each axis for each shape
- `total_bounds`: tuple of max and min coordinates on each axis for entire GeoSeries
- `geom_type`: type of geometry
- `is_valid`: tests if coordinates make a shape that is reasonable geometric shape according to the Simple Feature Access standard

#### Basic methods
- `distance()`: returns Series with minimum distance from each entry to other
- `centroid`: returns GeoSeries of centroids
- `representative_point()`: returns GeoSeries of points that are guaranteed to be within each geometry. It does NOT return centroids.
- `to_crs()`: change coordinate reference system. See projections
- `plot()`: plot GeoSeries. See mapping.

#### Relationship tests
- `geom_equals_exact()`: is shape the same as other (up to a specified decimal place tolerance)
- `contains()`: is shape contained within other
- `intersects()`: does shape intersect other

## GeoDataFrame
A GeoDataFrame is a tabular data structure that contains a GeoSeries.

The most important property of a GeoDataFrame is that it always has one GeoSeries column that holds a special status - the "active geometry column". When a spatial method is applied to a GeoDataFrame (or a spatial attribute like `area` is called), these operations will always act on the active geometry column.

The active geometry column – no matter the name of the corresponding GeoSeries – can be accessed through the `geometry` attribute (`gdf.geometry`), and the name of the geometry column can be found by typing `gdf.geometry.name` or `gdf.active_geometry_name`.

A GeoDataFrame may also contain other columns with geometrical (shapely) objects, but only one column can be the active geometry at a time. To change which column is the active geometry column, use the `GeoDataFrame.set_geometry()` method.

An example using the `geoda.malaria` dataset from geodatasets containing the counties of Colombia:

```python
import geodatasets

colombia = geopandas.read_file(geodatasets.get_path('geoda.malaria'))

colombia.head()
```
```
   ID      ADM0  ... RP2005                                           geometry
0   1  COLOMBIA  ...  61773  POLYGON ((-71.32639 11.84789, -71.33579 11.855...
1   2  COLOMBIA  ...  36465  POLYGON ((-72.42191 11.79824, -72.4198 11.795,...
2   3  COLOMBIA  ...  18368  POLYGON ((-72.1891 11.5242, -72.1833 11.5323, ...
3   4  COLOMBIA  ...   7566  POLYGON ((-72.638 11.3679, -72.6259 11.3499, -...
4   5  COLOMBIA  ...   9343  POLYGON ((-74.77489 10.93158, -74.7753 10.9338...

[5 rows x 51 columns]
```

```python
# Plot countries
colombia.plot(markersize=.5);
```
<!-- Image: colombia_borders.png -->

Currently, the column named "geometry" with county borders is the active geometry column:

```python
colombia.geometry.name
# 'geometry'
```

You can also rename this column to "borders":

```python
colombia = colombia.rename_geometry('borders')

colombia.geometry.name
# 'borders'
```

Now, you create centroids and make it the geometry:

```python
colombia['centroid_column'] = colombia.centroid

colombia = colombia.set_geometry('centroid_column')

colombia.plot();
```
<!-- Image: colombia_centroids.png -->

> **Note:** A GeoDataFrame keeps track of the active column by name, so if you rename the active geometry column, you must also reset the geometry:
> ```python
> gdf = gdf.rename(columns={'old_name': 'new_name'}).set_geometry('new_name')
> ```

> **Note 2:** Somewhat confusingly, by default when you use the `read_file()` command, the column containing spatial objects from the file is named "geometry" by default, and will be set as the active geometry column. However, despite using the same term for the name of the column and the name of the special attribute that keeps track of the active column, they are distinct. You can easily shift the active geometry column to a different GeoSeries with the `set_geometry()` command. Further, `gdf.geometry` will always return the active geometry column, not the column named geometry. If you wish to call a column named "geometry", and a different column is the active geometry column, use `gdf['geometry']`, not `gdf.geometry`.

### Attributes and methods
Any of the attributes calls or methods described for a GeoSeries will work on a GeoDataFrame – they are just applied to the active geometry column GeoSeries.

However, GeoDataFrames also have a number of extra methods for:

- Reading and writing files
- Spatial joins
- Spatial aggregations
- Geocoding

## Display options
GeoPandas has an `options` attribute with global configuration attributes:

```python
import geopandas

geopandas.options
```
```
Options(
  display_precision: None [default: None]
      The precision (maximum number of decimals) of the coordinates in the
      WKT representation in the Series/DataFrame display. By default (None),
      it tries to infer and use 3 decimals for projected coordinates and 5
      decimals for geographic coordinates.
  use_pygeos: False [default: False]
      Deprecated option previously used to enable PyGEOS. It will be removed
      in GeoPandas 1.1.
  io_engine: None [default: None]
      The default engine for ``read_file`` and ``to_file``. Options are
      'pyogrio' and 'fiona'.
  )
```

The `geopandas.options.display_precision` option can control the number of decimals to show in the display of coordinates in the geometry column. In the colombia example above, the default is to show 5 decimals for geographic coordinates:

```python
colombia['centroid_column'].head()
```
```
0    POINT (-71.74594 12.00885)
1    POINT (-72.56514 11.58174)
2    POINT (-72.35203 11.32204)
3    POINT (-73.14121 11.15251)
4    POINT (-74.64555 10.88454)
Name: centroid_column, dtype: geometry
```

If you want to change this, for example to see more decimals, you can do:

```python
geopandas.options.display_precision = 9

colombia['centroid_column'].head()
```
```
0    POINT (-71.745940217 12.008854228)
1    POINT (-72.565144214 11.581744777)
2    POINT (-72.352030378 11.322036612)
3      POINT (-73.1412073 11.152507044)
4    POINT (-74.645551117 10.884543716)
Name: centroid_column, dtype: geometry
```
